РИСАТЕНО (__RISATENO__) - created as a rethinking of [ARTSEY](https://artsey.io/) for the Russian language. 10 keys, two for each finger, choc spacing РИСАТЕНО designed for one-handed chord typing, the layout can be viewed [here](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/019e404b4ab5db93cd75010ad90777a4) (__still in development__). 

The original idea was to create a compact keyboard for typing on a smartphone, but it can also be used as a macro pad.
 
The name is made up of letters on the main layout layer.

РИСАТЕНО RGB is designed only for wired use.
